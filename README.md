OCR for Printed & Handwritten Text Detection
# text-from-image
This project uses EasyOCR and OpenCV to detect and extract printed and handwritten text from images. It works well on printed text and neat handwriting, with ongoing improvements for diverse handwriting styles. Ideal for document digitization, accessibility, and content moderation.

Overview

This project leverages EasyOCR and OpenCV to perform robust text detection on both printed and handwritten content. Built initially using Google Colab for rapid development and testing, this repository now contains the complete code for local deployment. The model performs well on neat handwriting and is being optimized for more complex handwriting styles.

Key Features

	•	Printed Text Detection: Efficient extraction of printed text from images.
	•	Handwritten Text Detection: Recognizes neat handwriting, with ongoing improvements for diverse handwriting styles.
	•	Flexible Input: Users can easily process images by providing an image path for text extraction.
	•	Real-World Impact: Ideal for document digitization, content extraction, and enhancing accessibility.

Technologies

	•	EasyOCR: State-of-the-art OCR model for text recognition.
	•	OpenCV: Advanced image processing library used for text localization and visualization.
	•	Python: The primary programming language for the solution.

Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:
	1.	Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ocr-text-detection.git
cd ocr-text-detection


	2.	Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Ensure EasyOCR and OpenCV are installed:
pip install easyocr opencv-python


How to Use

	1.	Place your image in the directory.
	2.	Modify the IMAGE_PATH in the script to point to your image:

IMAGE_PATH = "path_to_your_image.jpeg"  # Replace with your image path


	3.	Run the script:
process_image(IMAGE_PATH)


The code will process the image, detect printed and handwritten text, and display the image with rectangles around the detected text.

Contribution

Feel free to fork the repository, submit issues, and contribute to the project. Contributions to improve handwriting detection are especially welcome.
